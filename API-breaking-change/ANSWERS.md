## 1. What Is a Breaking Change?

A **breaking change** is any update to an API that causes previously functional client applications to fail or behave incorrectly. These changes break the contract between the API and its consumers and typically require client-side code updates to restore compatibility. Breaking changes can include alterations to the API's endpoints, data structures, or behavior.

### Examples of Breaking Changes

#### 1. Renaming or Removing Fields.

**Example:** Renaming `"condition"` to `"weatherCondition"` without backward compatibility will break clients expecting `data.Weather[0].condition`, resulting in undefined errors or application crashes.

#### 2. Changing Data Types

**Example:** Changing the "temperature" field from a string to an integer. Frontends expecting a string might encounter parsing or type errors. Even worse, if the temperature unit changes (e.g., from Celsius to Fahrenheit) without renaming the field, clients might misinterpret the values.

#### 3. Changing Structure or Hierarchy

**Example:** Nesting the Weather array under a new parent key `dailyForecast`. This breaks existing paths like `response.Weather`.

```json
{
  "dailyForecast": {
    "Weather": [
      {
        "hour": 0,
        "temperature": "18",
        "condition": "Clear"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 4. Removing Endpoints

**Example:** Deleting the `/v1/weather` endpoint without a replacement causes any clients relying on it to completely break.


## 2. Coordinating Across Multiple Frontends

Coordinating API schema changes across multiple frontend clients, each with different update cycles, requires a safe and gradual change strategy. Here’s how to approach it effectively:

In my previous role, I was responsible for rolling out changes across multiple internal APIs consumed by various frontend teams. Depending on the scope of the change, we used different strategies: for smaller changes, we introduced flags or headers within the API to toggle between old and new behavior. For larger schema updates, we created versioned APIs (e.g., /v2) to avoid breaking existing clients.

Clear communication and preparation were key. We always informed relevant teams well in advance, documented all changes in the API specs, and provided a sandbox environment for testing.

One example was the rollout of a new version of our internal sales analytics API. The existing /v1 endpoint couldn’t handle the updated data model after we migrated to a big data backend. Since multiple frontend teams, including legacy web apps, depended on /v1 and had long release cycles, we released a new /v2 endpoint while keeping /v1 active.

We worked closely with each team to understand their migration timelines and blockers. A phased deprecation plan was created, with a clear schedule, migration guide, and breaking change documentation. We also added deprecation warnings in Swagger and API responses. This allowed faster-moving teams to migrate early, while others had a defined timeline and full support throughout the transition.

Being on the other side, as a consumer of public APIs. I’ve also seen how well this can be done at scale. Providers like GCP or Python package maintainers often communicate breaking changes early through changelogs, release notes, and emails. They also surface deprecation warnings during usage (eg, when running a script with an outdated library). Internally, I believe this is supported by a client-version matrix that tracks which versions are still active, usage volume, and migration progress.

## 3. How to Catch Breaking Changes During Development?

Detecting breaking changes early has been a key part of my workflow, especially when multiple frontend teams depend on our APIs. In my last roles, we used a layered approach to catch these issues before they reached production. First, we maintained thorough automated tests - unit, integration, and end-to-end into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure response structures remained stable. We also relied heavily on API contract testing using tools like Swagger PactFlow. Each consumer defined contracts for the exact data structure they expected, and these were verified in the provider’s CI pipeline, so any schema mismatch would fail the build immediately. Alongside this, we enforced strict OpenAPI definitions, kept version-controlled with the codebase, and validated through linters and schema checks during development. For additional protection, we wrote integration tests simulating real client behavior—like having a mock frontend call /v1/weather and validate parsed response fields. Finally, our team culture emphasized reviewing code with a “breaking change mindset”, not just looking at the logic but proactively asking, “Will this impact a dependent client?” This multi-layered approach allowed us to catch and fix breaking changes early, often before they even hit QA.

## 4. Policy for Releasing Changes

In my previous team, we didn’t have a formally documented change management policy, but we consistently followed a “Backward Compatibility First” principle. Any change that could be introduced without affecting existing consumers was implemented directly, typically new fields or optional parameters, validated through our OpenAPI (Swagger) specs and reviewed via GitHub PRs.  a change couldn’t be made backward-compatible, such as removing fields or altering response formats, it was flagged as a breaking change and went through a more rigorous process.

For breaking changes, we followed a versioning policy based on semantic versioning (e.g., /v1, /v2) to clearly communicate the level of impact. A change request template was created, usually in the form of a GitHub issue or Jira ticket, including a description, impact assessment, migration plan, testing strategy and rollback plan. These changes were reviewed across backend, frontend, and QA teams in regular syncs.

We updated the API documentation in Swagger, included example payloads, and published release notes, outlining what changed and how teams could adapt. A sandbox environment was always available for early testing. After release, we used internal metrics dashboards to monitor usage. 

Even without a formal written policy, this structured, tool-backed process helped us consistently roll out changes without surprises or regressions.
